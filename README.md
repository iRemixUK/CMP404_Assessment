# Augmented Reality
For this project I was tasked with creating an augmented reality game for an android device using Unreal Engine 5 and the Google ARCore library. 
I chose to create a first-person tower defense game where the player must defend their tower from incoming waves of enemies using the android device to aim and shoot spells.
